# Your rule content

When writing automated tests, always follow these rules

- Unit tests should only test what a class is responsible for
- Handling interactions with other classes should use some kind of mocking strategy
- Only create integration tests when asked specifically to do so, and then under specific direction on what to test
- When fixing tests, focus on fixing and re-running one test at a time
- Never write tests to directly test private methods. Private methods should only be tested through the methods that call them
- When checking code coverage make sure to run the entire suite first as coverage reports are unreliable otherwise
