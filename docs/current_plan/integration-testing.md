# Integration Testing Plan

## Core Principles

### Development Best Practices
- Follow the RuboCop Ruby Style Guide strictly for all new code
- Work in small, focused slices that can be individually tested
- Test each change before moving to the next feature
- Keep PRs small and focused for easier review
- Document all new features and changes
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Testing Philosophy
- Integration tests should validate real-world usage scenarios
- Focus on testing public interfaces and behaviors
- Verify compatibility across different Rails versions
- Test both success and failure paths
- Include performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Test Environment Setup

### Dummy Rails Application
- Located in `spec/dummy`
- Minimal configuration to test gem functionality
- Multiple database adapter support
  - SQLite for quick tests
  - PostgreSQL for full integration testing
- Redis configuration for caching
- ActionCable setup for real-time features

### Test Matrix
- Rails versions: 7.0, 7.1, 8.0
- Ruby versions: 3.2.8, 3.3.0
- Database adapters: SQLite, PostgreSQL
- Redis versions: 6.x, 7.x

## Test Categories

### 1. Query Integration
- Database interaction tests
  - Cursor-based pagination with real data
  - Complex queries across different table sizes
  - SQL generation verification
  - Index usage validation

- Caching layer tests
  - Redis integration
  - Cache invalidation
  - Performance metrics
  - Memory usage

- Real-time update tests
  - ActionCable integration
  - Broadcast verification
  - Subscription management
  - Cursor position updates

### 2. Configuration Tests
- Initializer integration
  - Configuration validation
  - Default settings
  - Custom overrides
  - Environment-specific settings

- Feature toggles
  - Redis enablement
  - Caching configuration
  - Pagination settings
  - Buffer size adjustments

### 3. Performance Tests
- Load testing
  - Large dataset handling (1000+ records)
  - Concurrent access
  - Memory consumption
  - Query execution time

- Cache performance
  - Hit/miss ratios
  - Warm-up scenarios
  - Memory usage
  - Invalidation timing

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
1. Set up dummy Rails app
2. Implement basic CRUD tests
3. Verify configuration loading
4. Test basic pagination

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Add caching integration
2. Implement real-time updates
3. Test complex queries
4. Add performance benchmarks

### Phase 3: Edge Cases
1. Test error conditions
2. Verify concurrent access
3. Test with large datasets
4. Cross-version compatibility

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Implementation
1. Start with unit tests
2. Implement minimal feature
3. Add integration tests
4. Refactor and optimize
5. Document changes

### 2. Code Quality
1. Run RuboCop before commits
2. Maintain style guide compliance
3. Keep methods focused and small
4. Use clear naming conventions
5. Add inline documentation

### 3. Testing Practices
1. Write tests before implementation
2. Test both success and failure paths
3. Use realistic test data
4. Maintain test isolation
5. Keep tests focused and clear

## Success Criteria

### Code Quality
- All RuboCop checks pass
- Documentation is complete and clear
- Code follows SOLID principles
- No code smells or complexity issues

### Test Coverage
- Unit test coverage > 95%
- Integration test coverage > 80%
- All critical paths tested
- Performance benchmarks established

### Performance Metrics
- Query execution under 100ms

- Memory usage within limits
- Concurrent access handling

## Continuous Integration

### Build Pipeline
1. Run unit tests
2. Run integration tests
3. Check code coverage
4. Verify style compliance
5. Run performance tests
