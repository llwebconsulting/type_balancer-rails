# Integration Test Tracking Rules

## Purpose
Track integration test debugging progress to prevent circular debugging patterns and ensure systematic problem-solving.

## Log File Location
`docs/logs/testing-integration-tests.md`

## Required Sections

### Current Position
Every log file must maintain a current position section at the top with:
- Current Focus: What we're investigating
- Last Change: What was modified
- Current Issue: Problem we're solving
- Next Action: Planned next step

### Change Entries
Each change must be documented with:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- Files Modified
- Change Description
- Purpose
- Result
- Next Steps

## Usage Rules

### When to Review
- Before making ANY changes to test-related code
- When encountering a test failure
- Before trying a new approach to fix a failing test
- When resuming work after a break

### How to Review
- Read through all previous changes chronologically
- Pay special attention to similar approaches tried before
- Look for patterns in failed attempts
- Note any insights or learnings from previous attempts

### When to Log
- After EVERY code change, no matter how small
- When discovering new information about the problem
- When tests reveal unexpected behavior
- When changing approach or strategy

### What to Log
- All code changes with exact details
- Test results, including error messages
- Insights gained from debugging
- Reasoning behind strategy changes
- Links to relevant documentation or resources

## Prevention Guidelines
- Review log file before making changes to avoid repeating failed approaches
- Ensure all changes are documented with required sections
- Check log file for similar error patterns before proceeding

## Change Planning
1. Before making changes:
   - Review this log file to understand previous attempts
   - Ensure we're not repeating a failed approach
   - Document any patterns or insights from previous attempts
2. After making changes:
   - Document the changes immediately
   - Include specific details about what was changed
   - Record the results and observations
   - Note any new insights gained
3. When planning next steps:
   - Reference previous attempts
   - Explain why the new approach might succeed where others failed
   - Document the reasoning for the chosen direction
