# Integration Testing Change Log

## Current Position
🔍 **Current Focus**: Parameters not being passed correctly to method_missing
- Last Change: Switched to puts debugging and discovered empty data hash
- Current Issue: perform :custom_action, cursor_position: 10 results in empty data hash
- Next Action: Investigate ActionCable test framework's parameter passing mechanism

## Changes

### 2024-03-21 21:59 - Initial method_missing Implementation
**Files Modified**: `spec/dummy/app/channels/type_balancer_channel.rb`

**Change**:
- Modified `method_missing` signature from `method_missing(method_name, **data)` to `method_missing(method, data = {})`
- Added data conversion with indifferent access: `data.try(:with_indifferent_access) || {}`
- Simplified action parameter to use method name directly
- Removed debug logging

**Purpose**: 
To fix parameter handling in method_missing to properly receive and process cursor position updates.

**Result**:
Test failure showing cursor_position is still null when it should be 10:
```
Expected: {"action":"custom_action", "cursor_position":10, "collection":"test_collection"}
Actual:   {"action":"custom_action", "cursor_position":null, "collection":"test_collection"}
```

**Next Steps**:
Added debug logging to investigate how parameters are being passed to method_missing:
```ruby
Rails.logger.info "Method missing called with method: #{method.inspect}, data: #{data.inspect}, data class: #{data.class}"
Rails.logger.info "Data after conversion: #{data.inspect}"
```

### 2024-03-21 22:14 - Debug Logging Test Run
**Files Modified**: None (test run only)

**Change**:
Ran tests to capture debug output from method_missing, but no debug logs appeared in the output.

**Purpose**: 
To understand how parameters are being passed to method_missing by examining debug logs.

**Result**:
1. Debug logs not visible in test output
2. Same test failure persists:
```
expected to broadcast exactly 1 messages to type_balancer_test_collection with {"action"=>"custom_action", "cursor_position"=>10, "collection"=>"test_collection"}, but broadcast 0
Broadcasted messages to type_balancer_test_collection:
   {"action":"custom_action","cursor_position":null,"collection":"test_collection"}
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Check Rails.logger configuration in test environment
2. Consider alternative debugging approach (like puts or test-specific logging)
3. Verify test environment is properly loading our channel configuration

### 2024-03-21 22:15 - Debug Output Investigation
**Files Modified**: `spec/dummy/app/channels/type_balancer_channel.rb`

**Change**:
Switched from Rails.logger to puts for debugging and ran tests again.

**Purpose**: 
To see exactly how parameters are being passed to method_missing.

**Result**:
Critical discovery: The data hash is empty when method_missing is called:
```
[DEBUG] Method missing called with:
  - method: :custom_action
  - data: {}
  - data class: Hash
  - data after conversion: {}
```

This shows that even though we're calling:
```ruby
perform :custom_action, cursor_position: 10
```
The parameters are not making it to method_missing as expected.

**Next Steps**:
1. Research ActionCable's test framework parameter passing
2. Check if we need to modify how we're passing parameters in the test
3. Consider if there's a different method signature we should be using
