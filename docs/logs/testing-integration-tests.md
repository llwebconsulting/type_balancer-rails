# TypeBalancer Rails Testing Log

## Current Position
Current Focus: Unit test stability for collection methods and ActiveRecord extension
Last Change: Analyzed TypeBalancer interface through quality tests
Current Issue: Our test expectations don't match TypeBalancer's actual interface
Next Action: Update test expectations to match actual TypeBalancer interface

## Changes

### 2024-03-21 16:00
Files Modified:
- None yet, analyzing TypeBalancer interface

Change Description:
After reviewing TypeBalancer's quality tests and examples, found that:

1. TypeBalancer.balance only accepts:
   - collection (array of records)
   - type_field: Symbol
   - No weights parameter in balance method
   - No pagination parameters in balance method

2. Our Implementation Should:
   - Handle weights and pagination in our layer
   - Only pass type_field to TypeBalancer.balance
   - Handle the ordering of results ourselves

Purpose:
- Align test expectations with actual TypeBalancer interface
- Clarify separation of concerns between gems

Next Steps:
1. Update collection_methods_spec.rb:
   - Remove weights from TypeBalancer.balance expectations
   - Move pagination handling to our code
   - Test that we handle weights and pagination internally

2. Update active_record_extension_spec.rb:
   - Remove weights configuration tests
   - Focus on type_field configuration
   - Test proper extension of collection methods

3. Update implementation to match:
   - Store weights in options but don't pass to TypeBalancer
   - Handle pagination after balancing
   - Keep type_field as the only TypeBalancer parameter

Debug Context:
- TypeBalancer gem has simpler interface than we assumed
- We need to handle advanced features in our layer
- This explains the "Invalid keyword arguments" errors

Pattern Prevention:
- Always verify third-party gem interfaces before writing tests
- Keep clear separation of concerns between gems
- Document interface assumptions explicitly

### 2024-03-21 15:45
Files Modified:
- None yet, analyzing failures

Change Description:
Test suite ran with 21 examples, 15 failures. Main categories of failures:

1. Invalid Keyword Arguments (8 failures):
   - TypeBalancer.balance doesn't accept 'weights' parameter
   - TypeBalancer.balance doesn't accept 'page' or 'per_page' parameters

2. Method Not Found (2 failures):
   - `type_balancer_type_field` undefined
   - `type_balancer_weights` undefined

3. Expectation Mismatches (4 failures):
   - TypeBalancer.balance not receiving expected calls
   - Result size mismatch in chaining test

4. Interface Mismatch (1 failure):
   - Chainable methods not working as expected

Purpose:
- Identify patterns in test failures
- Group issues for systematic resolution
- Plan fixes based on actual TypeBalancer interface

Next Steps:
1. Check TypeBalancer gem's actual interface for balance method
2. Update test expectations to match real interface
3. Add missing configuration methods
4. Fix chaining implementation

Debug Context:
- Tests were written assuming TypeBalancer interface that doesn't exist
- Need to verify actual TypeBalancer API before fixing tests
- Configuration methods need to be implemented

Pattern Prevention:
- Verify third-party gem interfaces before writing tests
- Group similar failures for efficient fixing
- Document actual interfaces for future reference

### 2024-03-21 15:30
Files Modified:
- spec/spec_helper.rb

Change Description:
- Fixed gem require path from 'type_balancer-rails' to 'type_balancer_rails'
- Verified lib directory structure shows correct file name

Purpose:
- Fix gem loading in test environment
- Match require path with actual file structure

Result:
- Corrected require statement to match actual file name
- Maintained proper load path configuration

Next Steps:
1. Run tests again with corrected require path
2. Document any new failures
3. Address each failure systematically
4. Keep tracking changes in this log

Debug Context:
- Initial require path was using dashes instead of underscores
- Lib directory shows correct file is type_balancer_rails.rb
- Following Ruby conventions for file naming

Pattern Prevention:
- Double-check file structure before making require path assumptions
- Document correct require paths for future reference
- Keep consistent naming conventions across the project

### 2024-03-21 15:15
Files Modified:
- spec/spec_helper.rb

Change Description:
- Found initial test failure: LoadError for type_balancer-rails gem
- Tests are failing before they can run due to gem loading issues

Purpose:
- Get tests running by fixing basic setup issues
- Ensure proper gem loading in test environment

Result:
- Identified that we need to properly set up gem loading
- Need to update spec_helper.rb to correctly require our gem

Next Steps:
1. Update spec_helper.rb to use proper require path
2. Add lib directory to load path if needed
3. Verify gem loading works
4. Re-run tests to identify any remaining issues

Debug Context:
- Basic setup issue with gem loading
- Need to ensure test environment can find our gem code
- May need to adjust require statements or load paths

Pattern Prevention:
- Document load path configuration for future reference
- Ensure consistent gem loading across all test files
- Keep track of environment setup requirements

### 2024-03-21 15:00
Files Modified:
- spec/type_balancer/rails/collection_methods_spec.rb
- spec/type_balancer/rails/active_record_extension_spec.rb
- spec/spec_helper.rb

Change Description:
- Introduced TestRelation class for consistent test doubles
- Updated mocking strategy to better simulate ActiveRecord behavior
- Simplified test structure to focus on core responsibilities

Purpose:
- Create stable unit tests that properly test our code's responsibilities
- Ensure test doubles accurately represent ActiveRecord interface
- Remove unnecessary complexity in test setup

Result:
- Tests are more focused on our code's responsibilities
- Clearer separation between what we test and what we mock
- More maintainable test structure

Next Steps:
1. Run the complete unit test suite
2. Document any failures with specific error messages
3. Address failures one at a time without modifying integration tests
4. Only move to integration tests once unit tests are stable

Debug Context:
- Previous attempts mixed unit and integration testing concerns
- Test doubles weren't consistently representing ActiveRecord behavior
- Some tests were trying to verify TypeBalancer functionality instead of our integration code

Pattern Prevention:
- We will not modify integration tests until unit tests are stable
- We will document each change and its impact
- We will focus on one test file at a time
- We will verify changes don't break other tests before moving on

### 2024-03-21 14:30 UTC
Files Modified:
- spec/type_balancer/rails/collection_methods_spec.rb

Change Description:
- Removed weights parameter from TypeBalancer.balance expectations
- Updated test descriptions to be more accurate
- Added explicit test for storing weights but not passing to TypeBalancer
- Simplified pagination handling test to reflect that it's handled in our layer
- Added more comprehensive test contexts for different scenarios
- Improved test organization and clarity

Purpose:
To align test expectations with TypeBalancer's actual interface which only accepts type_field parameter

Result:
- Tests now correctly reflect that TypeBalancer.balance only accepts type_field
- Better separation of concerns between TypeBalancer and our gem's functionality
- More explicit testing of our gem's additional features (weights, pagination)

Next Steps:
1. Update active_record_extension_spec.rb to match the same interface assumptions
2. Run the full test suite to verify all changes
3. Document any remaining failures or issues
4. Update implementation code if needed to match the corrected interface

# Integration Test Debugging Log

## Current Position
Current Focus: Basic type balancing integration tests
Last Change: Updated test data format and TypeBalancer.balance parameters
Current Issue: Three test failures in basic type balancing integration
Next Action: Fix test failures related to ordering, pagination, and type balancing

## Changes

### 2025-04-11 02:31 PDT
Files Modified:
- spec/integration/basic_type_balancing_spec.rb

Change Description:
1. Removed unsupported `weights` parameter from TypeBalancer.balance calls
2. Changed test data from Hash objects to OpenStruct objects to match integration helper

Purpose:
- Fix parameter validation errors with TypeBalancer gem
- Ensure consistent data structure across tests
- Match shared context setup from integration_helper

Result:
Test run revealed 3 failures:
1. Order preservation test failing:
   - Expected reversed order but got original order
   - Need to implement order preservation in TestRelation
2. Pagination methods missing:
   - `limit` method undefined for TestRelation
   - Need to add ActiveRecord-like query methods
3. Type balancing parameter mismatch:
   - TypeBalancer receiving different OpenStruct format than expected
   - Need to normalize record attributes before passing to TypeBalancer

Next Steps:
1. Add query method support (limit, offset) to TestRelation
2. Implement proper order preservation in TestRelation
3. Normalize record attributes when passing to TypeBalancer
4. Re-run tests after implementing fixes
