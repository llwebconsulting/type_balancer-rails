# Integration Test Debug Plan

## Current Status (End of Day)
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Fixed type field default to `:type` to match TypeBalancer interface
- ✅ Removed unsupported options (weights, etc.)
- ❌ One integration test failing

## Next Steps

### 1. Review Failing Integration Test
- Run failing test in isolation to get clear error message
- Check test setup and expectations
- Verify test data is using `:type` field consistently
- Ensure test isn't trying to verify TypeBalancer's internal behavior

### 2. Interface Verification
- Audit all calls to `TypeBalancer.balance`
- Verify only passing supported options:
  ```ruby
  TypeBalancer.balance(items, type_field: :type)  # Only supported interface
  ```
- Remove any remaining code handling unsupported options

### 3. Test Environment
- Review `TestRelation` implementation
- Verify test data structure matches TypeBalancer expectations
- Check mocking strategy consistency
- Ensure pagination handling works correctly in test env

### 4. Documentation Alignment
- Update inline documentation
- Remove references to unsupported features
- Verify example code uses correct interface
- Update integration test descriptions

### 5. Integration Focus
- Ensure tests focus on Rails integration
- Verify ActiveRecord interface preservation
- Check relation chainability
- Test pagination integration

## Success Criteria
1. Integration test passes
2. No references to unsupported features remain
3. Documentation accurately reflects TypeBalancer's interface
4. Test coverage remains high
5. ActiveRecord interface is preserved
